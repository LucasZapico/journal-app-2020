## title: Markie 

A react hooks, firebase markdown and syntax workflow focused journal app.

__What the heck does that mean?__ 

The feature focus of iteration v1.5.0 is to facilitate the categorization of a given document This feature follows from the premise that most content falls into an array of sets, sets are defined in the case of this app as categories. This definition choice was made as the category use case in the digital environment seems to meet our needs the most closely.  
#### Challenge 

How do we keep content organized?I would argue breaking content into manageable sets. A challenge that arises with any organizing any set is that depending on the objective different attributes of our elements take varying degrees of priority. 

## The oolbox Analogy 

*Substutue "toolbox" with "art suplies", outdoor gear or whatever metaphor resonates*

The fundamental premise of this argument is given a set of objects that has not been surveyed or indexed. The fundamental premise of this argument is to order a set for a given end a reasonable majority of the sets definitive attributes must be rigorously understood.

#### Fundemental Premsise 

A few of the the fundamental premises that this project is constrained by are;

- The ordering of a set should be dynamic 

This follows from the implicit fact that organization at its fundamental requires a through understanding of the attributes or properties or the elements of a given set that is meant to be ordered. 

Second, the hierarchy of element properties is predicted by the desired end. 

For a simple example, given a set of socks. If the objective (initial constraint) of the wearer is to meet the criteria business casual the ordering of socks given this end will follow from greatest match to least. Now, assume the next criteria, constraint, objective is comfort. Now or ordering is likely to adjust based on this additional constraint. Where as in our first model assuming two pair of socks both met the the business causal constraint their position within a hieriarchy is equivocal. But, with the addition of a secondary  constraint in which both element have different attribute values. The secondary ordering will position the elements in a different hierarchy. 

The reason this complicates ordering in general is simply the



The toolbox metaphor is as follows. Suppose Jen buys some tools for a finishing project. As Jen has no other tools or equipment, it is reasonable to believe that these tool will go into general toolbox. Now, assume Jen gets a series of wood working project where she buys more tools. As the volume of tools is not too unreasonable, this set also go into the general toolbox. Next, Jen begins doing welding projects where she acquires tools particular for welding. At this point Jen decided that is it is more trouble than it is work to bring all of her all purpose tools, wood working and finishing tools to every project. Thus, she creates two sub-toolboxs, one for wood specific tools and one for welding tools and a super-toolbox for general tools that can be used for both welding and wood working. As we extend this model to more and more projects where a particular set of tools is highly applicable and another set of tools is below a  threshold. 



Let's assume Jen has set threshold of 50, this is the total number of elements times the applicability value between 1-10.  This means that for a given set if the total number of elements times the applicability value a subset is required.
