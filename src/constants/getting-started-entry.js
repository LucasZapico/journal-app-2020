    '# Getting Started With Mark\'ie Mark\'\'ie is a v1 journal application built and designed by Lucas Zapico. It supports all the syntax goodies that you would expect from markdown. But, then it takes a little turn. Mark\'ie is a syntax-based editor this means it uses syntactical sugar to interact with the app. For example, the following will add the "some category" to the app. __c__some category__c__   ----## Markdown Syntax # Header 1 ## Header 2### Header 3 #### Header 4 ##### Header 5 __Strong- something bold__*em - something italic*> Some amazing block quote  ```var codeBlock = "" codeBlock = "my code"console.log(codeBlock"```',
  categories: 'getting started',
