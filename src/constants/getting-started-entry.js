    "# Getting Started With Mark'ie\n\nMark'ie is a v1 journal application built and designed by Lucas Zapico. It supports all the syntax goodies that you would expect from markdown.\n\n But, then it takes a little turn. Mark'ie is a syntax-based editor this means it uses syntactical sugar to interact with the app. For example, the following will add the \"some category\" to the app. \n\n__c__some category__c__ \n\n---- \n\n## Markdown Syntax\n\n # Header 1\n\n ## Header 2\n\n ### Header 3\n\n #### Header 4\n\n ##### Header 5\n\n __Strong- something bold__\n\n *em - something italic*\n\n > Some amazing block quote\n\n ``` var codeBlock = '' codeBlock = 'my code' console.log(codeBlock)```",
